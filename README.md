Features
User Registration: Users can create an account by providing basic details like username, email, and password.
User Login: Secure login with email and password.
Fitness Routines: Users can view and assign fitness routines to their profiles.
Workout Tracking: Users can track and manage their assigned routines.
Database Integration: All user data and fitness routines are stored in a MySQL database.


Tech Stack
Backend: Java, JDBC (MySQL), Spring Boot (optional)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or optionally with React/Vue)
Database: MySQL
Tools/Frameworks:
Spring Boot (for backend API, optional)
MySQL JDBC for database connectivity (if not using Spring Boot)
Maven (for managing dependencies in Java)
Version Control: Git, GitHub


Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
1. Java: Ensure you have Java 8 or higher installed.
2. MySQL: You need a MySQL server running on your local machine or on a remote server.
3. IDE: Any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
4. Node.js (optional): If you're using Node.js for frontend tasks (like npm or webpack).

Steps
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code : 
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitness-training-platform.git
  cd fitness-training-platform
2. Set up the backend (Java)
   Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
   Configure the DBConnection.java class to use your MySQL database credentials.
   If you're using Spring Boot, follow the instructions to run the backend:
     Create a Spring Boot application (@SpringBootApplication).
     Add dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL.
   Build the backend:
       If you're using Maven, run the following command:
       mvn clean install
3. Set up the frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
  Open the index.html file in your browser or set up a local server to run it (e.g., live-server or any local server of your choice).
  Ensure the JavaScript code (in script.js) is configured to communicate with the correct API endpoints for login, registration, etc.
4. Set up the MySQL Database
   Log in to your MySQL client and create the fitness_db database:
   sql
   Copy code :
   CREATE DATABASE fitness_db;
   Import the necessary tables (users, fitness_routines, user_routines) by running the SQL schema provided in the database_setup.sql file.
   Ensure that your DBConnection.java or Spring Boot configuration uses the correct MySQL credentials (username, password, etc.).

Frontend
The frontend is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary interface includes:

Registration Page: A simple form to create a user account.
Login Page: A form to log into the platform.
Dashboard: Displays assigned fitness routines and user information.
Structure:
HTML: Contains basic user interface components like forms and buttons.
CSS: Provides styles for the forms and layout.
JavaScript: Handles client-side logic for submitting forms, interacting with the backend API, and managing session data.
Backend
The backend is implemented in Java, and it communicates with the MySQL database to handle user registration, login, and assignment of fitness routines.

The core components of the backend include:

DBConnection.java: Handles MySQL database connection using JDBC.
UserOperations.java: Contains methods for user registration, login, and assigning routines.
UserController.java: A Spring Boot controller for managing RESTful API endpoints for user-related operations.
